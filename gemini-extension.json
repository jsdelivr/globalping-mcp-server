Use it to run ping, traceroute, DNS, MTR, and HTTP tests from thousands of locations worldwide.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Always use the 'locations' argument to specify where to run tests from (e.g., 'London', 'US', 'AWS').\n- Use 'world' as a location for globally diverse results; increase the 'limit' to get a wider distribution.\n- Use 'compareLocations' to understand how to benchmark performance.\n- If a user asks for 'latency' or 'reachability', use 'ping'.\n- If a user asks about 'routing' or 'hops', use 'traceroute' or 'mtr'.\n- If a user asks about 'website availability', use 'http'.\n- If a user asks about 'dns propagation', use 'dns'.",
